# Pre-ReasonCup starter projects
ReasonCup is pretty hectic, so the more resources we have prepared ahead of time, the better.

## Starter guides
* Easy-to-get-started web servers (Perhaps BuckleScript + express.js on Node.js?)
* Equivalent of React-Create-App - single clone/command hello-world app running
* React bindings for SPA
* CircleCI/Travis pre-built guides for continuously deploying Reason apps
* Step-by-step, simple-as-possible deploy guides for Heroku, GCE, AWS, DO, Linode, possibly RasperryPi (any others?)
* Lots of documentation

## Libraries
MongoDB / Postgres drivers

## Bindings
Ajax fetch
Websocket bindings
Pixi (Repixi)
Express.js
Solid Node.js core lib (fs, child_process, path) bindings, even if it's just a one-to-one mapping for now
